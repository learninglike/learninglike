- 👋 Hi, I’m @learninglike
- 👀 I’m interested in ... to understand the hack word to reverse the hack to "friend" is being hacking me for more than a year.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... about to start learning to hack emails, long story short, ex neighbor stole my identity, and he has 8 dif. emails where i storage all my evidece that i have to take to court for domostic violence to my ex partner and save my 4 year old cause because he lies in court and won 100% costudy, last summer he left my son inside his car windows up and my son attach to his car seat, two days in a row, (i can not recorded video cause he left me homeless and at that piont my phone was 0% battery) Sometimes the authorities do not help you and they only make you waste time and time does not return, if the only way I have to recover my emails  in order to rescue my son from the hands of his narcissistic father, I will do it as many times as necessary.
maybe more than one will take me badly, thinking that it's been almost a year and I haven't done anything, the reality is I'm struggling every day with the worst depression of my life, my ex narcissistic partner left me homeless and twrow away all my things, a car he give me, he junked cause still under his name  and when I say he throw away all my things means ALL of them i only stayed with 3 pairs of jeans, 2 t-shirts, 1 sweater and a pair of shoes on 2018 i start buying new, vintage or used stuffs to sell on ebay, friends told me that I was ready to set up a store with so many things i had it was 4 years of dedicating time, money and effort, and from one day to the next, everything disappeared.
my emotions are a roller coaster, and I would never have imagined the thousands of different states that depression has, where literally from my point of view......... Depression is living in a body that fights to survive, with a mind that tries to die.
